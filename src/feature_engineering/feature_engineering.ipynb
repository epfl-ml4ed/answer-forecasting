associated with the features that have been extracted. Specifically, it should be noted that the mastery scores extracted are the most recent ones in the available student progress timeline. At the same time, the scores for each student were computed with all the available data. With this kind of preprocessing there's a certain (little) amount of \"data leaking\". However, this is fixed in ```feature_engineering_2.ipynb``` where we perform mastery-question timesteries matching. We also would like to test the following generalizations (in increasing order of difficulty):\n","\n","1) the pair (known student, question not seen for that student)\n","2) the pair (unseen student, known question)\n","3) the pair (unseen student, unseen question)  \n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.18"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
